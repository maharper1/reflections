What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

  It sets up the .git directory where the logging will occur.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
  You don't do anything to it directly. Accumulates changes for later commits.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
  Check it against the latest commit using git diff --stag

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?
  Whenever you want to test a new feature, etc.
